Single Sign On Kata
===================

You're just working on implementing the "Single Sign On" feature. The class "MyService" is supposed to check with the SingleSignOnRegistry that every request has a valid token. You already started building all the needed classes and unit test.  Unfortunately the unit test is rather slow and a bit unreliable. How could you redesign it to be fast and reliable?
